On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?

I chose this question because, as somebody who prefers the aisle seat in almost every situation, I think it's annoying when I have to get out of my seat to let people out â€” or worse, when they try to climb over me. Interestingly, the respondents of this survey seem to be generally less bothered than me given that a majority of respondents said getting up between 2 to 3 times from a non-aisle seat is acceptable for a 6 hour flight, with more than 100 respondents stating that they'd even tolerate a non-aisle seater getting up 4 times. As such, this survey revealed that fliers are generally okay with people getting up from the inside seats a couple times during a moderately long flight.
